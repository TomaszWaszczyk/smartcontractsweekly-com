tracking your investment ideas, successes and setbacks, and using those insights to continuously upgrade your strategy, is critical to the success of every investor.</p><p>What <i>does</i> come as a surprise is the lack of tools designed to help investors do exactly that, and how far short the few existing solutions fall.</p><p>It surprises us, at least — not just as investors looking to improve ourselves, but as a team of product makers that see a wide open opportunity in the rapidly growing individual investment market.</p><p>That combination of personal need and clear market opportunity was what lead us to begin building Fey, a more modern and intelligent trading journal, as our first in-house product.</p><p>But to create change, we had to first find out — why are things like this?</p><p>In this article, we’ll highlight the current state of the trading journal marketplace, how technology is changing attitudes around personal investing, and why now is the right time to create a product like Fey, designed to help traders of every experience level grow.</p><h2>The ideal trading journal</h2><p><highlight>Improving performance in any area requires constant learning and adaptation.</highlight> This is true in everything, from product and business development to individual growth — and it’s <i>especially </i>true in personal investing, where individuals put their personal resources on the line within an environment that frequently and suddenly changes.</p><p><b>The ideal trading journal would help traders:</b></p><ol><li><p>Understand their baseline investment performance and track their growth</p></li><li><p>Develop new ideas and monitor positions that they’re not ready to invest in just yet</p></li><li><p>Keep all notes, charts links and reports organized and quick to access</p></li></ol><p>We say the <i>ideal</i> trading journal <i>would</i> help traders because, as far as we can tell, nothing close to the ideal trading journal exists on the market. A search on Google Images for “trading journal” highlights a key problem: everything either looks exactly like Excel, or <i>is literally just Excel.</i></p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/txu76a3w3kbd/5n4R5g7UJlOWUQl7tkyo50/01bf8a49d1181daaa6068133db90144c/google-search-trading-journal-min__1_.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"image__regular image__with_shadow\"/>\n          </div><p>Indeed, most investors that do keep a trading journal today — including ourselves — use note taking tools like Evernote or Bear to store charts, notes, snippets and 10-Ks, alongside Excel or Google spreadsheets that track research and performance data. In a survey we conducted among people who signed up for Fey early access, 97% of respondents described using this exact workflow.</p><p>It’s <i>technically possible</i> to keep some form of trading journal, which is at least better than not keeping one at all. But merely storing data isn’t the goal of trade journaling;<b> </b>learning from and acting on it is. And at every step, these tools get in the way more than they help because they’re simply not designed to help you <i>do anything</i>. They’re designed to store data.</p><p>While technology has opened up investing to anyone with a bank account and an internet connection, it’s done little to empower investors outside of the Bloomberg Terminal income bracket to make more thoughtful investment decisions — even as a new generation of young, capital-light investors is on the rise.</p><h2><b>A new wave of investors</b></h2><p>Search queries for terms like “how to invest” have more than doubled in the past ten years, and grown over 40% in the past three years alone. However, the spike in 2017 — and at least some of this overall growth — is due to the sudden explosion of interest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the price of which spiked during this same period.</p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <figure>\n              \n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/txu76a3w3kbd/256txgC4hYGxAbcOdOMuw5/5e0fdd391e333deca5746344b3571d0a/how-to-invest.svg\" alt=\"Keyword traffic from Google Trends.

When a popular company like Tesla posts earnings, they discuss the news: “I’ve known these people for years, but we never talked about this stuff before Robinhood.”</p></blockquote><p>Until recently, the mainstream perception of investing has focused on its inscrutability and potential for financial loss (undoubtedly influenced by the Great Recession at the end of the 2010s). But that intimidation seems to be fading among younger generations, who are beginning to see investing akin to a hobby at its most casual, and a discipline to be honed for traders that become more committed, with educational resources available online for every experience level and type of investing.</p><p>However, just because the fear of risk has lessened doesn’t mean that investing has become risk-free. Many fresh investors that have bought into hype over value, or put their emotional interest in a company before its performance, have lost everything in the process.</p><p><highlight>For all of the resources and tools online that make it easy for people to start investing, few are designed to help them become more strategic traders.</highlight></p><p>Vanity dashboards, spreadsheets and high-level how-to articles alone won’t get this done. Investors need more insight into their own <i>personal behavior </i>as an investor: to identify the negative patterns that need examining, the positive patterns worth exploring, and the metrics that indicate long-term success, pulled directly from their own live portfolio.</p><h2><b>Fey, the future trading journal</b></h2><p>This is the part where we wish we could say we have a tool that solves it all.</p><p>Well... we don’t. But we think we will very, very soon.</p><p>We’ve been quietly building our trade journaling app, <a href=https://feyapp.com target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fey</a>, for quite a while. Earlier this year we opened up early access registration at <a href=https://feyapp.com target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">feyapp.com</a>; anyone that registers for early access will be first on the list to get their one-on-one onboarding when Fey is ready for launch.</p><p>Based on our research including a survey of our early access registrants, we’ve identified three key areas where we feel Fey can deliver incredible value where existing options don’t.</p><ul><li><p><b>Speed: </b>Eliminate the time lost to manual data entry and switching between platforms</p></li><li><p><b>Design: </b>Create a beautiful interface that highlights the most valuable information</p></li><li><p><b>Community: </b>Stay connected with users and address feedback with product updates</p></li></ul><p><b></b></p><h3><b>Speed</b></h3><p>When we asked people who signed up for Fey early access what their biggest frustrations were in tracking their trades and investments today, the responses overwhelmingly fell into two buckets:</p><ol><li><p>It takes too long to input data, screenshots and snippets</p></li><li><p>Fragmented across different tools, that data becomes confusing and slow to read</p></li></ol><p>The time and labor involved in manually entering data, copying and pasting screenshots and snippets between different platforms, and keeping it all organized prevent many traders from fully committing to journaling and reaping its full benefits.</p><p>To make keeping a trading journal something traders <i>actually enjoy doing</i> — and to help keep them consistently journaling — Fey needs to be exponentially faster than any of the trading journal “solutions” that exist today. </p><p>That’s why Fey stores all of your charts and notes, automatically keeping them organized and linked to both your <b>live positions</b> and your <b>trade ideas </b>— hypothetical positions that you’re not ready to take just yet, but want to watch the performance of over time. And when data does need to be pulled in from an external tool (like a charting platform or your broker), Fey will automate all the steps in-between.</p><p>Keyboard navigation is one other way that speed is core to journaling with Fey: with just a quick key shortcut, you’ll be able to navigate anywhere within your journal and execute nearly any action.</p><p></p><h3><b>Design</b></h3><p>To design a trading journal that’s actually fast and fun to use, we believe it’s necessary to think outside the box — or in this case, the spreadsheet.</p><p>Yet as the screenshots we highlighted show, most trading journals today consist of seas of table cells filled with context-free numbers, and charts that often seem to serve as visual filler, wrapped up in interfaces that are enough to make one yearn for the days of the command line.</p>\n          <blockquote class=\"pull__quote\">In our years of developing products, we’ve seen how good design has the power to simplify the complex, and transform the tedious into the enjoyable.</blockquote>\n        <p>Fey is for <b>anyone</b> that wants to become a more thoughtful, well-informed investor. But confusing or visually unappealing products alienate all but the most committed users, who are willing to power through a poor experience. We personally aren’t — and we don’t think anyone else should have to either.</p><p>In our years of developing products, we’ve seen how good design has the power to simplify the complex and transform the tedious into the enjoyable, which empowers people to learn and accomplish things they’d never imagined before. To help a new generation of traders grow and keep committed to it, Fey needs to be something that investors actually look forward to opening up.</p><p>That’s why we’re designing Fey to be easy on both the eyes and mind, with dark colors that make it comfortable to journal for hours at a time, an interface that’s quick to navigate and always highlights the most critical information first, and charts that are actually there to keep traders informed.</p><p></p><h3><b>Community</b></h3><p>We’re committed to helping investors grow over the long-term, and making it easier for them to share their ideas and their progress with whoever they want. That’s why we’re building features like a <b>privacy mode </b>that lets you view and share your Fey dashboard with others while keeping all sensitive information hidden, and the ability to create public links to your <b>positions and trade ideas</b> that include your charts and notes so other traders can follow along.</p><p>Beyond that, we believe the most critical part of building an engaged community is to constantly <b>adapt the product to their needs and feedback as investors</b> — something our early access feedback has shown us that existing solutions fail to do. We believe that the best way for us to do so is to launch Fey to a small number of early access users first, onboarding each one-on-one to guarantee a great experience, and charging a low monthly fee for access.</p><p>As the team behind Fey, <a href=https://narative.co target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Narative</a> is part independent product developer, and part studio-for-hire. We want to keep control of our ideas and the quality of their execution within our team, and that means our funding for the products we build comes directly from our customers — and those are the people we want to stay accountable to.</p><p>While free (or “free*”) products ultimately tend to attract many more users, our goal isn’t to get Fey to a million users ASAP. <highlight>We want to build a sustainable business and grow alongside our users</highlight>, continuously shipping product updates that improve their experience and address their feedback. The price of a cup of coffee per day (we’re still working out the exact amount) is one we’re confident is worth paying to make this possible.</p><h2><b>Don’t miss what’s next</b></h2><p>Whether you’ve never kept a trading journal before or are already a daily die-hard, we’re looking forward to showing you more of the ways Fey will change the way you think about trading.</p>\n          <div class=\"CallToAction\">\n            <div class=\"CallToAction__content\">\n              <h3>Want to try Fey for yourself?</h3>\n              <p>Sign up to receive product updates and get access to Fey as soon as we launch at feyapp.com.</p>\n              <div class=\"CallToAction__links\">\n                <a href=\"https://feyapp.com\" target=\"_blank\"><svg\n    width=\"18\"\n    height=\"14\"\n    viewBox=\"0 0 18 14\"\n    fill=\"none\"\n    xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n  >\n    <path\n      fill-rule=\"evenodd\"\n      clip-rule=\"evenodd\"\n      d=\"M15.6751 13.4383H2.2393C1.00257 13.4383 0 12.4357 0 11.199V2.24177C0 1.00504 1.00257 0.00247015 2.2393 0.00247015H16.4215C17.0914 -0.03596 17.7047 0.377313 17.9205 1.01267C18.1364 1.64804 17.9018 2.34934 17.3471 2.72695L10.4053 8.06394C9.56548 8.70952 8.38823 8.67837 7.58375 7.9893L3.27684 4.30192C3.07417 4.12858 2.97936 3.86029 3.02814 3.5981C3.07692 3.33591 3.26187 3.11966 3.51332 3.03081C3.76478 2.94196 4.04453 2.99401 4.2472 3.16734L8.55412 6.85472C8.82819 7.07706 9.22054 7.07706 9.49462 6.85472L16.4364 1.51773L2.2393 1.49533C1.82705 1.49533 1.49286 1.82952 1.49286 2.24177V11.199C1.49286 11.6112 1.82705 11.9454 2.2393 11.9454H15.6751C16.0873 11.9454 16.4215 11.6112 16.4215 11.199V5.2275C16.4215 4.81525 16.7557 4.48106 17.1679 4.48106C17.5802 4.48106 17.9144 4.81525 17.9144 5.2275V11.199C17.9144 12.4357 16.9118 13.4383 15.6751 13.4383Z\"\n    />\n  </svg>Get early access</a>\n                \n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <p>If you’re already signed up for early access — thank you for helping us get here.

Narative is a digital studio that focuses on creating the best brands and products in the world. Our team works on everything from page based websites to complex web apps. The core of our engineering team works in the React ecosystem and has experience from some of the best startups in Canada.</p><p>Traditionally, building page based websites, such as marketing websites, landing pages, or blogs would require a vastly different skillset from building interactive web apps. There are popular tools such as WordPress or Drupal that are written in their own flavour of PHP or static site generators such as Jekyll, Hugo, and Middleman that leverage templating to build static websites. The problem we’ve found with these tools is that there is very little overlap between web app development and page based development. Within the last couple years, React has taken over web app development and popularized an intuitive API for building user interfaces. React has also created an astonishing community of developers that are focused on creating amazing tools to accelerate and improve UI development.</p><hr/><p>Part of our mission at Narative is to provide technical excellence through an engineering team that is proud and cohesive. To help accomplish this, <b>we need a team that can share its knowledge, tools, and skills amongst itself and with the community around it.</b></p><h2>The beauty of Gatsby</h2><p>Gatsby allows our team to use the powerful React API when creating page based websites with almost no drawbacks. All the principles and techniques we’ve learned from using React for the last few years can be leveraged with Gatsby. This has enabled us to create a team that is extremely dynamic and cohesive without the worry of creating silos or losing knowledge across teams. Our team is able to learn once, write everywhere. With an engineering team that’s familiar with React and Gatsby we’re able to tackle more problems faster, which is highly beneficial to our partners and the services we offer.</p>\n          <blockquote class=\"pull__quote\">Gatsby has enabled us to create a team that is extremely dynamic and cohesive without the worry of creating silos or lost knowledge across projects.</blockquote>\n        <p>One concern we had when adopting Gatsby is that page based websites are not the same as web apps. Even though we’re using similar tools to build them there are different principles that drive each type of development. Luckily, our team doesn’t have to worry about that problem, because the team behind Gatsby is focused on delivering the perfect experience to end users for us. The Gatsby team has baked in all the necessary features to make our websites fast and up to standard.</p><h2>Gatsby’s fast, really fast</h2><p>Gatsby handles a lot of the complexity of delivering a fast website for you. There are new performance standards built into it; we don’t have to worry about code splitting, service workers / progress web app capabilities, server side rendering, asset optimization, and basic security. To get an idea of the speed visit the <a href=https://www.gatsbyjs.com/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">official website of Gatsby</a>!</p><p>Great performance out-of-the-box is a huge win. Our team does not have to focus on these optimizations anymore. Instead, we focus on telling the story and building the values of our partners into our websites and web apps.</p>\n          <blockquote class=\"pull__quote\">Gatsby does not only allow us to deliver faster websites, but it has also sped up our development time.</blockquote>\n        <h3>Developing with Gatsby is fast, really fast</h3><p>Gatsby does not only allow us to deliver fast websites, it has also sped up our development time. The developer experience is another focus of the team behind Gatsby — and it shows. Features such as live reload are ready to go at when you start a new project. There’s no need to setup a custom Webpack configuration as the basics are completed for you. Building your website and deploying is also carefully thought out by Gatsby and often requires running a single command and using one of the many integrations for hosting. Furthermore, the documentation is comprehensive and has plenty of content from introductory guides to complex use cases. This has been amazing for training and on boarding new members of our team, especially if they’re already familiar with React.</p><h2>Separation between view and data layers</h2><p>Many popular CMS tools are tightly coupled to their source of data. Gatsby offers a clear separation between the data and view layer building on top of the Headless CMS principles. The advantage for Narative is that we can develop without CMS lock-in such as WordPress. If our team decides to go with a new view layer the migration would be less painful than migrating all the data as well. Often times flexibility in software means more complexity to manage but in this case the flexibility is in the right spots where it reduces complexity.</p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/txu76a3w3kbd/5idlN5rrtCuh9IXAowITIO/109b1df53d8f1b970950f1bdb4f69207/88ac9534b448cd0cc51be316598aa0c6.svg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"image__regular \"/>\n          </div><p>We pass this flexibility on to our partners. They are able to manage their data while our team is able to deliver an excellent product on top of their existing infrastructure. This has made our solutions to revamping legacy projects even stronger than before.</p><h2>Plugins and integrations</h2><p>Tools such as WordPress have a strong appeal because of the maturity and vast plugin ecosystem build around it. Gatsby has a well architected plugin-system that has already met our needs at Narative. The plugins are modern, plentiful, and easy to create if needed.</p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <figure>\n              \n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/txu76a3w3kbd/529mcYMb8kWYOJjJSU6Vlx/878f6955ada7a4c0ee4007ff0f3bd8f7/medium-post_plugins-white.jpg\" alt=\"[object Object]\" class=\"image__large \"/>\n          </div>\n              <figcaption></figcaption>\n            </figure>\n          </div>\n        <p>Beyond all the plugins, Gatsby provides integrations into today’s popular tools. Integrations such as Contentful are a perfect match for Gatsby because of the separation between data and view layers. Every major hurdle we thought we’d have to solve has already been taken care of by the Gatsby team and their custom integrations.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Narative strives for technical excellence for all its products, which can be achieved with React, Gatsby, and GraphQL for us. We’ve landed on a solution that allows our team to stay cohesive and flexible. Thanks to the popularization of React and the principles behind it Narative has been able to build page based websites and web apps with the same expertise. In the past, it was hard to share knowledge and tools between page based websites and web apps but now there’s very little difference.</p><p>Gatsby streamlines our process with an excellent developer experience and all the features you could ask for in 2018. The heavy lifting of delivering a technically sound website with performance that users will love has slowly shifted towards frameworks such as Gatsby, which has freed up our team to focus on even better experiences and products.</p>\n          <twitter twitterId=\"1004043574646751233\"></twitter>\n        \n          <blockquote class=\"pull__quote\">Most importantly, at Narative, Gatsby has introduced a new excitement for page based websites. This opens a new chapter of development and innovation for us that we can’t wait to explore.</blockquote>\n        <p>To conclude, Gatsby may not be the perfect solution for your project, but for our needs it’s perfect. By building with Gatsby, we’ve extended our team to an amazing group of people that are working hard to improve page based websites. We’re excited to see where Gatsby takes us next.</p>","backgroundImage":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":3,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/txu76a3w3kbd/6mJoH6XjYPSYMP141wKRdf/f7a0c496a66aed7ac75f3e353bd96ac1/Preview-Why_Narative_loves_Gatsby_2x-min.jpg?w=1140&h=380&q=100","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/txu76a3w3kbd/6mJoH6XjYPSYMP141wKRdf/f7a0c496a66aed7ac75f3e353bd96ac1/Preview-Why_Narative_loves_Gatsby_2x-min.jpg?w=285&h=95&q=100

tracking your investment ideas, successes and setbacks, and using those insights to continuously upgrade your strategy, is critical to the success of every investor.</p><p>What <i>does</i> come as a surprise is the lack of tools designed to help investors do exactly that, and how far short the few existing solutions fall.</p><p>It surprises us, at least — not just as investors looking to improve ourselves, but as a team of product makers that see a wide open opportunity in the rapidly growing individual investment market.</p><p>That combination of personal need and clear market opportunity was what lead us to begin building Fey, a more modern and intelligent trading journal, as our first in-house product.</p><p>But to create change, we had to first find out — why are things like this?</p><p>In this article, we’ll highlight the current state of the trading journal marketplace, how technology is changing attitudes around personal investing, and why now is the right time to create a product like Fey, designed to help traders of every experience level grow.</p><h2>The ideal trading journal</h2><p><highlight>Improving performance in any area requires constant learning and adaptation.</highlight> This is true in everything, from product and business development to individual growth — and it’s <i>especially </i>true in personal investing, where individuals put their personal resources on the line within an environment that frequently and suddenly changes.</p><p><b>The ideal trading journal would help traders:</b></p><ol><li><p>Understand their baseline investment performance and track their growth</p></li><li><p>Develop new ideas and monitor positions that they’re not ready to invest in just yet</p></li><li><p>Keep all notes, charts links and reports organized and quick to access</p></li></ol><p>We say the <i>ideal</i> trading journal <i>would</i> help traders because, as far as we can tell, nothing close to the ideal trading journal exists on the market. A search on Google Images for “trading journal” highlights a key problem: everything either looks exactly like Excel, or <i>is literally just Excel.</i></p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/txu76a3w3kbd/5n4R5g7UJlOWUQl7tkyo50/01bf8a49d1181daaa6068133db90144c/google-search-trading-journal-min__1_.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"image__regular image__with_shadow\"/>\n          </div><p>Indeed, most investors that do keep a trading journal today — including ourselves — use note taking tools like Evernote or Bear to store charts, notes, snippets and 10-Ks, alongside Excel or Google spreadsheets that track research and performance data. In a survey we conducted among people who signed up for Fey early access, 97% of respondents described using this exact workflow.</p><p>It’s <i>technically possible</i> to keep some form of trading journal, which is at least better than not keeping one at all. But merely storing data isn’t the goal of trade journaling;<b> </b>learning from and acting on it is. And at every step, these tools get in the way more than they help because they’re simply not designed to help you <i>do anything</i>. They’re designed to store data.</p><p>While technology has opened up investing to anyone with a bank account and an internet connection, it’s done little to empower investors outside of the Bloomberg Terminal income bracket to make more thoughtful investment decisions — even as a new generation of young, capital-light investors is on the rise.</p><h2><b>A new wave of investors</b></h2><p>Search queries for terms like “how to invest” have more than doubled in the past ten years, and grown over 40% in the past three years alone. However, the spike in 2017 — and at least some of this overall growth — is due to the sudden explosion of interest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the price of which spiked during this same period.</p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <figure>\n              \n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/txu76a3w3kbd/256txgC4hYGxAbcOdOMuw5/5e0fdd391e333deca5746344b3571d0a/how-to-invest.svg\" alt=\"Keyword traffic from Google Trends.

When a popular company like Tesla posts earnings, they discuss the news: “I’ve known these people for years, but we never talked about this stuff before Robinhood.”</p></blockquote><p>Until recently, the mainstream perception of investing has focused on its inscrutability and potential for financial loss (undoubtedly influenced by the Great Recession at the end of the 2010s). But that intimidation seems to be fading among younger generations, who are beginning to see investing akin to a hobby at its most casual, and a discipline to be honed for traders that become more committed, with educational resources available online for every experience level and type of investing.</p><p>However, just because the fear of risk has lessened doesn’t mean that investing has become risk-free. Many fresh investors that have bought into hype over value, or put their emotional interest in a company before its performance, have lost everything in the process.</p><p><highlight>For all of the resources and tools online that make it easy for people to start investing, few are designed to help them become more strategic traders.</highlight></p><p>Vanity dashboards, spreadsheets and high-level how-to articles alone won’t get this done. Investors need more insight into their own <i>personal behavior </i>as an investor: to identify the negative patterns that need examining, the positive patterns worth exploring, and the metrics that indicate long-term success, pulled directly from their own live portfolio.</p><h2><b>Fey, the future trading journal</b></h2><p>This is the part where we wish we could say we have a tool that solves it all.</p><p>Well... we don’t. But we think we will very, very soon.</p><p>We’ve been quietly building our trade journaling app, <a href=https://feyapp.com target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fey</a>, for quite a while. Earlier this year we opened up early access registration at <a href=https://feyapp.com target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">feyapp.com</a>; anyone that registers for early access will be first on the list to get their one-on-one onboarding when Fey is ready for launch.</p><p>Based on our research including a survey of our early access registrants, we’ve identified three key areas where we feel Fey can deliver incredible value where existing options don’t.</p><ul><li><p><b>Speed: </b>Eliminate the time lost to manual data entry and switching between platforms</p></li><li><p><b>Design: </b>Create a beautiful interface that highlights the most valuable information</p></li><li><p><b>Community: </b>Stay connected with users and address feedback with product updates</p></li></ul><p><b></b></p><h3><b>Speed</b></h3><p>When we asked people who signed up for Fey early access what their biggest frustrations were in tracking their trades and investments today, the responses overwhelmingly fell into two buckets:</p><ol><li><p>It takes too long to input data, screenshots and snippets</p></li><li><p>Fragmented across different tools, that data becomes confusing and slow to read</p></li></ol><p>The time and labor involved in manually entering data, copying and pasting screenshots and snippets between different platforms, and keeping it all organized prevent many traders from fully committing to journaling and reaping its full benefits.</p><p>To make keeping a trading journal something traders <i>actually enjoy doing</i> — and to help keep them consistently journaling — Fey needs to be exponentially faster than any of the trading journal “solutions” that exist today. </p><p>That’s why Fey stores all of your charts and notes, automatically keeping them organized and linked to both your <b>live positions</b> and your <b>trade ideas </b>— hypothetical positions that you’re not ready to take just yet, but want to watch the performance of over time. And when data does need to be pulled in from an external tool (like a charting platform or your broker), Fey will automate all the steps in-between.</p><p>Keyboard navigation is one other way that speed is core to journaling with Fey: with just a quick key shortcut, you’ll be able to navigate anywhere within your journal and execute nearly any action.</p><p></p><h3><b>Design</b></h3><p>To design a trading journal that’s actually fast and fun to use, we believe it’s necessary to think outside the box — or in this case, the spreadsheet.</p><p>Yet as the screenshots we highlighted show, most trading journals today consist of seas of table cells filled with context-free numbers, and charts that often seem to serve as visual filler, wrapped up in interfaces that are enough to make one yearn for the days of the command line.</p>\n          <blockquote class=\"pull__quote\">In our years of developing products, we’ve seen how good design has the power to simplify the complex, and transform the tedious into the enjoyable.</blockquote>\n        <p>Fey is for <b>anyone</b> that wants to become a more thoughtful, well-informed investor. But confusing or visually unappealing products alienate all but the most committed users, who are willing to power through a poor experience. We personally aren’t — and we don’t think anyone else should have to either.</p><p>In our years of developing products, we’ve seen how good design has the power to simplify the complex and transform the tedious into the enjoyable, which empowers people to learn and accomplish things they’d never imagined before. To help a new generation of traders grow and keep committed to it, Fey needs to be something that investors actually look forward to opening up.</p><p>That’s why we’re designing Fey to be easy on both the eyes and mind, with dark colors that make it comfortable to journal for hours at a time, an interface that’s quick to navigate and always highlights the most critical information first, and charts that are actually there to keep traders informed.</p><p></p><h3><b>Community</b></h3><p>We’re committed to helping investors grow over the long-term, and making it easier for them to share their ideas and their progress with whoever they want. That’s why we’re building features like a <b>privacy mode </b>that lets you view and share your Fey dashboard with others while keeping all sensitive information hidden, and the ability to create public links to your <b>positions and trade ideas</b> that include your charts and notes so other traders can follow along.</p><p>Beyond that, we believe the most critical part of building an engaged community is to constantly <b>adapt the product to their needs and feedback as investors</b> — something our early access feedback has shown us that existing solutions fail to do. We believe that the best way for us to do so is to launch Fey to a small number of early access users first, onboarding each one-on-one to guarantee a great experience, and charging a low monthly fee for access.</p><p>As the team behind Fey, <a href=https://narative.co target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Narative</a> is part independent product developer, and part studio-for-hire. We want to keep control of our ideas and the quality of their execution within our team, and that means our funding for the products we build comes directly from our customers — and those are the people we want to stay accountable to.</p><p>While free (or “free*”) products ultimately tend to attract many more users, our goal isn’t to get Fey to a million users ASAP. <highlight>We want to build a sustainable business and grow alongside our users</highlight>, continuously shipping product updates that improve their experience and address their feedback. The price of a cup of coffee per day (we’re still working out the exact amount) is one we’re confident is worth paying to make this possible.</p><h2><b>Don’t miss what’s next</b></h2><p>Whether you’ve never kept a trading journal before or are already a daily die-hard, we’re looking forward to showing you more of the ways Fey will change the way you think about trading.</p>\n          <div class=\"CallToAction\">\n            <div class=\"CallToAction__content\">\n              <h3>Want to try Fey for yourself?</h3>\n              <p>Sign up to receive product updates and get access to Fey as soon as we launch at feyapp.com.</p>\n              <div class=\"CallToAction__links\">\n                <a href=\"https://feyapp.com\" target=\"_blank\"><svg\n    width=\"18\"\n    height=\"14\"\n    viewBox=\"0 0 18 14\"\n    fill=\"none\"\n    xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n  >\n    <path\n      fill-rule=\"evenodd\"\n      clip-rule=\"evenodd\"\n      d=\"M15.6751 13.4383H2.2393C1.00257 13.4383 0 12.4357 0 11.199V2.24177C0 1.00504 1.00257 0.00247015 2.2393 0.00247015H16.4215C17.0914 -0.03596 17.7047 0.377313 17.9205 1.01267C18.1364 1.64804 17.9018 2.34934 17.3471 2.72695L10.4053 8.06394C9.56548 8.70952 8.38823 8.67837 7.58375 7.9893L3.27684 4.30192C3.07417 4.12858 2.97936 3.86029 3.02814 3.5981C3.07692 3.33591 3.26187 3.11966 3.51332 3.03081C3.76478 2.94196 4.04453 2.99401 4.2472 3.16734L8.55412 6.85472C8.82819 7.07706 9.22054 7.07706 9.49462 6.85472L16.4364 1.51773L2.2393 1.49533C1.82705 1.49533 1.49286 1.82952 1.49286 2.24177V11.199C1.49286 11.6112 1.82705 11.9454 2.2393 11.9454H15.6751C16.0873 11.9454 16.4215 11.6112 16.4215 11.199V5.2275C16.4215 4.81525 16.7557 4.48106 17.1679 4.48106C17.5802 4.48106 17.9144 4.81525 17.9144 5.2275V11.199C17.9144 12.4357 16.9118 13.4383 15.6751 13.4383Z\"\n    />\n  </svg>Get early access</a>\n                \n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <p>If you’re already signed up for early access — thank you for helping us get here.
