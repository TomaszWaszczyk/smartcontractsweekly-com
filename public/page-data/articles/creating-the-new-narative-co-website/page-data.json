Team","title":null,"slug":null,"biography":null,"avatar":null},"body":"<p>Between <a href=https://narative.co/articles/building-the-new-hopper-com target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our work with our partners at Hopper</a> and developing our <a href=https://www.feyapp.com/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">finance journaling app Fey</a>, Narative has had plenty to keep us busy in our studio’s less-than-a-year of existence.</p><p>But one thing that <i>hadn’t</i> been keeping us busy was our website at Narative.co — and it certainly did show. With a homepage consisting of two sentences and navigation that largely linked to outside sites like Medium and Twitter, it was on the user to do the work in understanding who we are and what we do, and we weren’t giving them much to work with.</p><p>While this served us well early on as enthusiastic referrals from our professional network kept us plenty busy, anyone <i>unfamiliar</i> with us would struggle to get a clear picture of the value we bring. That needed to change.</p><p>Our major goals in revamping our website were to:</p><ul><li><p>Swiftly help prospective clients envision the potential of working with us</p></li><li><p>Display our approach hands-on in an interactive and memorable way</p></li><li><p>Take control of our content by moving articles from Medium to our site</p></li></ul><p>All while presenting everything in a way that feels unique and representative of what we do at Narative. In this article, we’ll dive into the strategy, design and technology behind the new Narative.co and what it means for our company’s future.</p><h2><b>Honing the message</b></h2><p>There is a ton of talent out there ready to help businesses build and grow their products. While the companies we&#39;ve built our careers and experience in are well-known, as a new independent studio, Narative itself lacks history and exposure.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean we can’t be the best pick for the partners we work with. The question we felt most necessary to answer: <b>why would businesses seriously consider choosing us?</b></p><h3>1. We build brands, websites and products</h3><p>Before getting into what makes Narative unique, we want to immediately echo the needs that are top-of-mind for potential clients so that they know we’re speaking their language, even if we personally feel it undersells what we do. It can be tempting to lean into aspirational-yet-vague language about <i>innovative change</i> and <i>digital experiences </i>that make it seem like we can do anything and everything, but our clients don’t tend to think in those terms — neither should we. Once we establish this basic, easy-to-understand premise, we can begin layering the more unique elements on top.</p><h3>2. Our background is in growing startups, not agencies</h3><p>We actively avoid referring to ourselves as an “agency” both because it can set the wrong expectations, and because our team doesn’t have a typical agency background. The Narative team is made up of people with senior-level experience in building and marketing products at growing companies in-house. We approach each partnership with a mindset closer to that of an internal team than an external agency, digging deep into the needs of each company and their customers before we begin building anything.</p><h3>3. We’re experts in the problems that growing companies face</h3><p>Whether a business is just starting up, hitting its stride or expanding into an enterprise, there is one problem common to every stage of growth — there are <i>always</i> more opportunities worth seizing than resources on-hand to seize them. Having faced those challenges in the companies we’ve worked in before, we’ve learned how to apply focus and seize the right opportunities at every step of the journey. We work closely with our partners to help their companies reach their fullest potential.\n</p><hr/><p>\nThe goal of the new Narative homepage would be to <b>express and support these key messages as concisely as possible</b>. We want to quickly establish mutual understanding and build the confidence necessary for them to either reach out to us about their next project, or continue exploring our site to learn more.</p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <figure>\n              \n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/217seOSniqUxNVOughLqD2/7f160d6bcda48c2ed3c3d583b9c2fd07/google-docs-copy-deck.gif\" alt=\"We apply some light styling while working in Google Docs to emulate the feel of the final page.\" class=\"image__regular image__with_shadow\"/>\n          </div>\n              <figcaption>We apply some light styling while working in Google Docs to emulate the feel of the final page.</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n          </div>\n        <p>We chose to retain the two-sentence heading structure from the original homepage and roll it out across each page on the site, as it fits well with the conversational tone we’re going for and gives us the space to be both clear and creative. </p><p>Consistent with that, we chose to present most of copy on our homepage as a letter to the user, complete with punctuation and even entire paragraphs! It’s a bit funny to talk about full sentences as if they are some bold design decision, but look around the web and it’s easy to see how the pressure to cram in as many points possible has lead to an epidemic of pages that feel like collections of barely-connected bullet lists, leaving little space to inspire or explore.</p><p>It also makes it difficult for the reader to know which content is worth focusing on — and with <i>focus</i> playing a key role in our messaging, we knew it was important for us to not just say that it matters, but to show the value first-hand.\n</p><h2><b>Designing for focus</b></h2><p>In his seminal book on usability design <i>Don’t Make Me Think, </i>Steve Krug explains that “people tend to spend very little time <i>reading </i>most web pages. Instead, we scan them, looking for words and phrases that catch our eye. [...] On most pages, we’re really only interested in a fraction of what’s on the page. We’re just looking for the bits that match our interests or tasks at hand, and the rest of it is irrelevant.”</p><p>Users don’t tend to read web pages linearly from top-to-bottom; they rapidly scan the page looking for relevant information, and only once it’s spotted do they zero in on the details.</p><p>One reason for this may be that experience has taught users that most of the information on a page is, indeed, irrelevant. </p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <figure>\n              \n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/1LWJpxdb96JTdXSDYiJbRv/5fec37f07b33c8cc8ccc7f00ec6d3774/dont-make-me-think-min.jpg\" alt=\"Example adapted from Chapter 2 of Steve Krug’s Don’t Make Me Think, Revisited.\" class=\"image__large \"/>\n          </div>\n              <figcaption>Example adapted from Chapter 2 of Steve Krug’s Don’t Make Me Think, Revisited.</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n          </div>\n        <p>While modern web design looks much cleaner than the example above, it also carries forward many of the same issues. We’ve gotten better at hiding interface elements and traded in rigid tables for responsive grids, but still, ultimately prioritize designing web pages for information <i>density</i> rather than <i>impact</i>.</p><p>Much of this is due to the process by which web pages are typically designed: brainstormed as a series of slots for final content to fill in the future, with only a vague idea of what that content will look like. When you know you need to communicate to users about topics <b>A, B </b>and<b> C, </b>it seems obvious to separate the page into sections A, B and C — but what’s obvious isn’t necessarily what’s best.</p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <figure>\n              \n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/6JIUksO4Jm0qSYLUur9Lby/ed6311ed5e945f182859da10045e181b/whiteboard-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wireframing is a valuable tool for exploring potential designs, but be careful to not let it limit your final design’s potential.

Image: UI Stencils</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n          </div>\n        <p>That’s why we <b>finalize copy as much as possible before moving onto design</b>, experimenting with different approaches in text before laying out the page.<b> </b>Earlier drafts of our new homepage copy were longer and more sectioned in structure, with the decision to cut it drastically down coming late in the process — a decision that would have been much more painful to make had we locked ourselves into a template beforehand.</p><p>With the copy locked down, we set our sights on designing the homepage to encourage thoughtful comprehension over swift skimming. The fundamentals we settled on:</p><h3>Present one element at a time</h3><p>The more elements there are visible on-screen, the more work the user has to do in figuring out which ones are relevant, resulting in them skimming the page as quickly as possible before really taking any of it in. Our approach was to limit the content to only what’s relevant, and give each element space to breathe without overlapping with others.</p><h3>Use animations to draw the reader forward</h3><p>Animations can make pages and applications feel more polished, but overdoing them can end up distracting users rather than guiding them forward. We chose to only animate elements that we want users to interact with next and to fade in each paragraph individually, so that they catch the eye while skimming and are easier to read.</p><h3>Avoid heavy shapes and bold colors</h3><p>To keep the focus on the message, we opted for large, light type on nearly-black backgrounds, and avoided having visual elements that would compete with the text for attention. Where we did opt for illustration and color, we keep things light with line-work and outlined shapes in soft, glowy hues inspired by the tech we love.</p><hr/><p>One area where you can see these fundamentals of focus come together is at the <b>bottom of the homepage.</b> While it’s common today to hide site navigation by default to retain focus on the content, the tradeoff in doing so is that the navigation becomes less discoverable, and consequently, your site becomes slightly more complicated to explore.</p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/12rbHZ9pbeJ6RWnr48hyhr/7ed55ba307c553e72392376ae1497a18/nav-footer.gif\" alt=\"null\" class=\"image__large \"/>\n          </div><p>\nWe chose in the end to make that tradeoff, but not without considering the best path for users to take through Narative.co. When someone first lands on our homepage, we don’t <i>want</i> them to immediately start exploring; we want to set the context by helping them understand who we are first. Once the user hits the bottom of the page, the full menu appears at the top of the screen to show users the full breadth of our site and invite them to explore more.</p><h2><b>Show, don’t tell</b></h2><p>We don’t use the word <i>design</i> anywhere in our homepage copy. The same goes for <i>development</i>, <i>engineering </i>and <i>copywriting</i>, too. Nonetheless, these are all obviously pretty important parts of what we do. So what gives?</p><p>Simply put, those are <i>inputs</i>, not <i>outcomes</i>. We want visitors to get excited about the potential of partnering with us, and that excitement isn’t going to come from reading an extensive list of every discipline under our belt. Plus, some things are better conveyed without words.</p><p>It’s a waste of our readers’ time for us to talk about how great we are at designing and building things <i>while they’re interacting with something we’ve designed and built</i>. We have the opportunity to show them first-hand.</p><p>At the same time, we wanted to keep the focus on the <i>potential</i>, and avoid encouraging preconceived notions of what those outcomes might look like. One of the reasons we keep our color palette constrained and visuals abstract is to avoid projecting a “house style” onto all of the work that we do. We adapt our approach to the needs of our clients and their own customers, and being too aggressive with our own branding could overwhelm that.</p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/5aF08ettP4goeWGgJDBv8P/18a5a6077c07e5f56da1c6d9ef6e152a/nar-hop-min.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"image__full \"/>\n          </div><p>In exploring how to express our studio’s approach in both inspiring and abstract ways, we ourselves looked for inspiration in the tools that we use every day.</p><hr/><p>When users first land on the new Narative.co on a desktop browser, they’re greeted by a brief description of who we are and how we can help, and then invited to manipulate the artwork on the page itself — to participate with us in the digital creative process.</p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <figure>\n              \n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/36ufdmrL1iyOX4cjDt9cm5/6c5745a6eac8dc7ea10b5aeba5425df2/morph-header.gif\" alt=\"The animation in motion.

It’s <i>your </i>square now.</p><p>We experimented with more complex shapes and animations that were pretty, but not nearly as fun or memorable as something you could play with yourself. This implementation was heavily inspired by <a href=https://www.figma.com/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Figma</a>, a web-based design tool that allows an unlimited number of people to collaborate on a design in real time, and a tool which has been transformative to how we collaborate as a team.</p><p>Of course, large displays and precise cursor control are the domain of desktops, not mobile devices, which is why we opted to limit this interactive version to desktop devices only. On mobile devices, where screen real estate <i>and</i> user patience are both significantly tightened, we keep the focus mostly on the copy. But there are other visuals on display that users across all devices to see.</p><hr/><p>In keeping with the theme of <i>creativity</i>, we collaborated with industrial designer <a href=https://www.instagram.com/fazdes/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mohammed Fazil</a> to create artwork for our homepage and the hero sections across our website. Faz’s futuristic takes on familiar products had previously caught our eye, with repeated sketch lines revealing glimpses of the creative and iterative process behind each piece.</p><p>The result of that collaboration is a beautiful series of illustrations across our site representing both the process and outcomes of creative thinking, from the everyday objects that help us do our work, to icons of invention like the lightbulb, typewriter and smartphone reimagined through a futuristic lens.</p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/2AqYHKmTA7Lij8wUEr923d/ff78d7af39f5a385ea3378b72de51f94/illustration-min.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"image__regular \"/>\n          </div><p>The desire to let visitors immediately experience our work first-hand was also one of the driving factors in us deciding to build our own on-site articles section (which you are currently reading this post on), and move our existing content from Medium onto our site.</p><p>Content management systems are one of the most common types of projects that people ask us about, and so we saw this as a great opportunity to help inspire on the potential of collaborating with us. But there were also other factors in our decision to move away from Medium:</p><h3>Control over the presentation of our content</h3><p>The Medium aesthetic has become synonymous with writing about business and tech, but that aesthetic can be extremely limiting. If we’re writing about the work we do at Narative, it makes sense to present that content in a way that we feel is representative of that work; Medium’s limited formatting tools and homogenous looks just don’t allow us to do that.</p><p>One thing we <i>did </i>keep from Medium to align was defaulting to a white background on articles only, to delineate them from the rest of our site and to align with user expectations on what an “article” might look like — but as dyed-in-the-wool dark mode fans ourselves, you can bet we’ve kept dark mode just a quick click away.</p><h3>Rethinking our content strategy for the long term</h3><p>Medium makes it extremely easy to publish and distribute content, which is one of the reasons it’s so popular. But publishing on any third-party service means that we ultimately don’t own where our content lives, and Medium itself is prone to radical shifts in business model. While their renewed focus on paid subscriptions and editorial content could be great news for independent writers, that isn’t us. To improve our rankings in search results and to build long-term relationships with our audience, hosting our own content is necessary.</p><h3>Encourage exploration across Narative.co</h3><p>We’ve kept our marketing copy to a minimum, but that doesn’t mean we don’t have plenty to say. Hosting our content on Medium makes it impossible to integrate that content into other parts of our site; worse, it forces us to send users <i>away from our site</i> in order to read it, where we lose control of the experience. Keeping our content on Narative.co encourages users to continue navigating within our website to learn about <i>and</i> experience more of what we do.</p><h2><b>What’s behind the curtain</b></h2><p>Encouraging users to explore our site to experience more of our work and perspective first-hand would be pointless if it didn’t feel good to explore. And for this strategy to be viable, we need the freedom to continuously add new content to the website without making significant work for ourselves each time.</p><p><b>There are three core tools in our tech stack that help make all this possible:</b></p><p><a href=https://www.contentful.com/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Contentful</b></a><b> </b>is a “headless” content management system; in the simplest terms, it stores all of your content like text and media. But it <i>doesn’t </i>contain any styling or themes like WordPress or many other CMSs do; Contentful treats your content as just <i>content</i>, so you can send it to any page or channel, and use it with any framework. It’s simple enough to use that those in even the least technical roles can feel comfortable updating content by themselves. And because the data isn’t tied to any actual sites or applications, we can easily move CMSs later if we need to.</p><p><a href=https://www.gatsbyjs.org/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Gatsby</b></a> is a web framework that makes websites quick to deploy and even quicker to click around. Gatsby only loads the most critical code necessary to render the page, and then pre-loads following pages as soon as it detects a user is <i>about</i> to click on them, delivering a speedy browsing experience for the user. Gatsby is based on <a href=https://reactjs.org/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">React</a>, a Javascript library for building application interfaces that our team has deep experience building web apps with; among all those other benefits, Gatsby allows us to leverage that experience in building static websites.</p><p><a href=https://www.netlify.com/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Netlify</b></a> deploys any changes to our site as soon as we make them, whether those changes are in our repository or Contentful. And its integration with Contentful means that if something goes wrong while publishing, anyone can see what went wrong.</p><hr/><p>Beyond the individual advantages of these tools, their true benefit is in how seamlessly they work together. Contentful makes it easy to manage and create content; Gatsby lets us pull content from any data source and present it however we want; and Netlify makes sure that content always gets to the user, and fast.</p><p>All of these tools prioritize speed. But there are some other tricks we pull to make the site feel even faster, especially for users <b>navigating on mobile devices</b>, where speed — and the perception of it — are even more paramount.</p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/2OQK6iprC5WoeLZ5V7B5D3/70b6b182eb255f29943911fdba694996/nav-animation.gif\" alt=\"null\" class=\"image__large \"/>\n          </div><ul><li><p>When the user toggles the navigation open, the current page content slides down to reveal the menu. The<b> primary menu options are located within the easiest-to-reach section of the screen</b>, with social media links — a lower priority for us here — kept further up.</p></li><li><p>The user can close the menu either by pressing the menu toggle again, or more likely, by simply tapping or, more likely, by simply <b>swiping up on the content that is still in view </b>at the bottom of the screen. We keep this content in view to make it easy to toggle back to it, to remind the user where they already are and to create a sense of space within the site.</p></li><li><p>When the user selects a menu option, we mask the content from the previous page, close the navigation and then load the new page in. This feels like a more native experience on mobile devices, and makes the transition between pages feel seamless.</p></li></ul><p>Navigation is just one area of the site where we take advantage of animations to make the experience feel faster and more familiar to the device the user is browsing from. While the content and design of the site are nearly identical across all devices, the way it feels to interact with can greatly differ — as it should.</p><h2><b>One step forward, many steps ahead</b></h2><p>Launching the new Narative.co means much to our business today. It’s the clearest expression yet of the impact we create for the partners we work with, and the values that matter to us both as creative professionals and as a team building this business together.</p><p>But it will mean much, much more for us in the days and months ahead. We’ll continue to iterate on the content, design and functionality of our site over time, and share the results of that work here with you. And the ease of making changes and publishing new content on Narative.co makes it easier than ever for us to do both.</p><p>We open up as much of our work as possible to the design and technology communities, and we can’t wait to share more soon.

Good ideas are everywhere.</p><p>But it takes more than good ideas to build and grow a business. It takes people to bring them into reality. Are those people collaborating and sharing their expertise, or are they in conflict and keeping it to themselves?</p><p>Do they have the resources necessary to execute on their ideas? Or are they constantly under pressure to pluck only the lowest-hanging fruit through bare minimum means, while putting their greatest ambitions on the back-burner?</p><p><b>These are the circumstances that suffocate creativity and destroy value in an organization. </b>That’s why I knew that if I was going to start a company, our first product would have to be the company itself.</p><hr/><p>Companies themselves are a kind of product, distinct from the products they create. They are systems that process inputs (such as creative work and technology) into more valuable outputs — the products and services that are ultimately sold. The ability to effectively transform those inputs into outputs essentially defines the potential of a company.</p>\n          <blockquote class=\"pull__quote\">Companies themselves are a kind of product, distinct from the products they create.</blockquote>\n        <p>You would expect that, with the absolutely critical use case the <i>company-as-a-product</i> serves, it would be designed and optimized with the same care as the products it creates. But this is rarely the case. Instead, it’s largely left to chance, or channelled into a misguided focus on “culture” that is more about theatrics than it is about creating tangible benefits for companies and their employees — not to mention their customers.</p><p>That doesn’t mean culture isn’t critical. But you can’t just conjure it up or enforce like a set of commandments; it’s the result of <i>what you do.</i> Jason Fried, the founder and CEO of <a href=https://basecamp.com/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Basecamp</a>, summarized this well recently:</p>\n          <twitter twitterId=\"1052991621065834499\"></twitter>\n        <p>(Just prior to publishing this piece, I learned that the latest book co-written by Jason, <i>It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work</i>, opens with a chapter on “your company as a product.” Any similarities to the above are unintentional, and you can trust that we’ve ordered our copies in recompense.)</p><p>Culture is the programming of an organization, the energy that motivates every component into action, the perspective it projects into the world. And yet so often there seems to be ongoing tension between a company’s culture and the business it does daily.</p><p>To set up Narative’s culture to thrive free of that tension, I first looked at how its business model could support it.</p><h2>Building a business</h2><p>Before deciding to start up <a href=https://narative.co/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Narative</b></a>, I’d worked as a product designer at both creative agencies and startups for over a decade.</p><p>I’d recently left a full-time role and was excited to start a company where I could build the kinds of products I’d always wanted to, with a team I would play an active role in building.</p><p>Doing that would require the financial resources to attract and retain top talent in a competitive marketplace. However, I also wanted to avoid raising capital and giving up equity at this stage; I felt it was important to keep control over the quality of our products and to focus on building value for the team, rather than for investors.</p><p>This ultimately leads to the decision to split Narative’s focus between building digital products and strategies for client-companies looking to hire an outside team (which we call <b>Narative Studio</b>), while simultaneously developing our own products in-house with the goal of bringing them to market ourselves (which we call <b>Narative Labs</b>).</p><p><b>The benefits of this split are equal parts financial and cultural:</b></p><ul><li><p>Diversifying our revenue beyond our own products would give us stability and flexibility to pursue projects that we believe in, and grow the team more quickly.</p></li><li><p>Alternating between client work and internal projects would continuously expose us to new strategies, challenges and solutions, strengthening the quality of our output on all fronts.</p></li></ul><p>Despite the upsides, there are clear risks to this approach. Client work and product development are both resource-intensive individually, and we wouldn’t have much talent to spare.</p><p>With client work being our initial source of revenue, <b>any required shift in resources would be </b><b><i>away</i></b><b> from building our own products. </b>This meant our major vulnerability would be finding time to develop and bring to market our very first product.</p><p>It also raised the question of whether building those products was simply a distraction from generating leads and reliable revenue with client work.</p><p>But the goal of founding <a href=https://narative.co/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Narative</a> was never just to spin up another creative agency (which is why we never refer to ourselves as one). It was to create a company where good ideas could be pursued no matter their form, by a team with the talent and the means to pursue them.</p><p>And so rather than over-fixate on the risks, we instead looked to our first product as an opportunity to fund that pursuit.</p>\n          <blockquote class=\"pull__quote\">The goal was to create a company where good ideas could be pursued no matter their form, by a team with the talent and the means to pursue them.</blockquote>\n        <p>If we could launch even an alpha version of a viable SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) product, and acquire just a few hundred users at an industry-tested price point, <b>it would generate enough revenue to cancel out our primary expense: salaries</b>. This could expand our run rate by more than 50%, providing financial security for the company and the resources our team needs to succeed.</p><p>Like any good business story, this is where a bit of fortune enters into the equation. As I was preparing to start Narative, I discovered two of our soon-to-be co-founders were already working to bring their own product to market, in an industry they were intimately familiar with.</p><p>That product is <a href=http://feyapp.com/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Fey</b></a>, a tool for tracking trades and investments designed to eliminate the many issues, minor and major, that plague investor workflows every day.</p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/1AmsRQxXrI7ilNSjFNUstx/7c86304d84cb75ecee08d8a078909cf3/fey-landing-page-min.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"image__large \"/>\n          </div><p>Prior to Narative’s founding, hundreds of users had already registered to get early access to Fey, and competitive analysis revealed many opportunities to solve real pains in the market. It would be premature to call this product-market fit, but the signs were good that it could be achieved.</p><p><b>It just needed the right team to put the idea to the test.</b></p><h2>Building a team</h2><p>Rather than focusing solely on design and development experience, academic degrees or those with agency backgrounds, we prioritized bringing on individuals with real-world experience in startups and scaling companies — both for the sake of <a href=http://narative.co/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Narative</a>’s growth as a startup, and to provide our clients with the skills and guidance they need.</p><p>While the <i>volume</i> of experience wasn’t critical, it was important to collect informed perspectives on the challenges growing companies can face. Many agencies can do branding, design and development (<a href=https://narative.co/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we included</a>). Not as many can integrate that work into the metrics growing companies are focused on, like user acquisition, churn and revenue, to name a few. It would also bring valuable awareness of the cultural pains that can come with that growth.</p><p>As a designer co-founding a business, I knew there were gaps in my knowledge and perspectives I would need others to support. And as early conversations with potential team members began, I felt that the most promising candidates also spoke frequently of their own weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and how they hoped to grow and overcome them.</p>\n          <blockquote class=\"pull__quote\">As a designer co-founding a business, I knew there were gaps in my knowledge and perspectives I would need others to support.</blockquote>\n        <p>To build a company that could continuously adapt and grow, it was important to center the team around a growth mindset — the idea that our talents and skills can be developed through thought, effort and feedback, as opposed to being fixed and innate elements of our personality.</p><p>That might sound obvious, but in reality, businesses don’t always encourage internal growth by design. Carol Dweck, a professor of psychology at Stanford University, <a href=https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote about this for Harvard Business Review</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“When we face challenges, receive criticism, or fare poorly compared with others, we can easily fall into insecurity or defensiveness, a response that inhibits growth. Our work environments, too, can be full of fixed-mindset triggers. A company that plays the talent game makes it harder for people to practice growth-mindset thinking and behavior, such as sharing information, collaborating, innovating, seeking feedback, or admitting errors. To remain in a growth zone, we must identify and work with these triggers.”</p></blockquote><p>The more open you are in any relationship, personal or professional, the more vulnerabilities you’ll inevitably expose. If a professional environment only rewards success and punishes the mistakes or weaknesses that are the natural stepping stones to growth, the entire organization can revert to a fixed mindset and become frozen in place.</p><p>In 2012, <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google began an internal research project</a> to identify the common traits of high-performing teams. They discovered that the defining factors had nothing to do with talent nor individual personality traits; instead, the key was in how comfortable the group as a whole felt being authentic and vulnerable with each other. Psychologists and researchers define this as psychological safety, the “<a href=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Group_Performance/Edmondson%20Psychological%20safety.pdf target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.</a>” Building a growth mindset starts with creating an environment where people feel safe simply being themselves.</p><hr/><p>Ensuring open communication from the outset was critical for another reason: <a href=http://narative.co/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Narative</b></a><b> would launch as a 100% remote company.</b> Like our decision to pursue both client work and our own products, the motivation behind this was equal parts financial and cultural: not having an office keeps our fixed costs down, and it simply seems like bad business to limit your talent search to within an hour of yourself.</p><p>Many employers bristle at the thought of requiring — or merely <i>allowing</i> — their teams to work remotely, but this is largely an issue of trust. <i>“How do I know if people are really working if I can’t see them doing it?”</i></p><p>Measuring a team’s output based on the perceived time and effort invested is a destructive attitude, to begin with, distracting them from focusing on doing work that truly makes a difference.</p><p>Much of the time spent under the guise of <i>hard work</i> is really spent posturing, politicking and otherwise keeping up the appearance of selfless effort. The rigid hierarchies of many workplaces big and small demand it, treating opportunities for professional growth and success as a zero-sum game.</p><p>It obviously doesn’t need to be this way, and it’s one of the reasons we’re keeping Narative’s hierarchy as flat as possible.</p><p><b>On our </b><a href=https://www.narative.co/careers target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>careers page</b></a><b>, we promise everyone who joins the team the opportunity to make “executive-level decisions.”</b> We aren’t looking for people to merely execute the ideas we already have in place. Instead, every member of the team plays an active role in deciding what products we build, which clients we pursue and how we approach every problem.</p><p>We incentivize contribution and motivation not with an ever-escalating ladder of titles and tensely-negotiated raises, but through providing an opportunity to create the kind of company each of us have always wanted to work at, and to bring our ideas to life — along with helping others do the same.</p><h2>Building the future</h2><p>While we’re excited about the products we’re building in-house, we don’t see our work with clients as merely a means to an end. As I wrote earlier, <b>we want to pursue good ideas, no matter their form. </b>We’re equally excited about working with innovative businesses to help build their story and bring it to the world.</p><p>One of those innovators is Hopper, who we’ve been happy to have as one of our early clients. We <a href=https://medium.com/narative/building-the-new-hopper-com-c19ec83a0bbd target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">documented the process of building Hopper.com</a> to better communicate what’s unique about their product, people and brand.</p>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/3o9YmFKVW25IcaLkg2k21W/88f3e17933d8ed42ca744c517d81409a/hopper-quote-min.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"image__large \"/>\n          </div><p>The positive reception to that project has been extremely gratifying, along with seeing how our relationship with the Hopper team has grown over the time we spent working on it. Today, they consider us partners and seamlessly integrate our work into theirs in ways even we couldn’t have imagined.</p><hr/><p>Our work with Hopper has also helped us shape our approach to clients in general, as we focus on longer-term, high-value engagements with minimal overlap between clients. This allows us to stay focused on each client while still freeing up the resources necessary to move forward with ideas of our own.</p>\n          <blockquote class=\"pull__quote\">Our company isn’t about creating a particular thing; it’s about creating the context to make things great.</blockquote>\n        <p>Meanwhile, the assets and methodologies we develop for our in-house products end up finding their way into our work for clients like Hopper. The work we do for our own products improves the quality of the work we can provide for our clients, and vice-versa. The creation of each output strengthens every other output.</p><p><b>This doesn’t happen by chance; it’s explicitly part of the way we’ve designed our company to function, as a product in and of itself.</b></p><p>And importantly, this cycle of growth can exist regardless of what products we’re building or which clients we’re working with, because our business isn’t about a singular “good idea”.</p><p>If a market we want to enter changes, or we simply reassess our plans and want to pursue something else, our company won’t face an existential crisis because it isn’t about creating a particular <i>thing</i>; it’s about <i>creating the context to make things great.</i></p><hr/><p>In less than six months, <b>we’ve exceeded our 7-figure revenue goal and invested it directly back into the team</b>, now six people strong and sure to grow more soon. We’ve shipped some amazing client projects, and are hard at work behind the scenes bringing two of our own products to market — one being <a href=http://feyapp.com/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Fey</b></a>, and another we’ll talk more about soon. And we’ve done it all with zero funding or loans.</p><p>We’re excited to move forward with trust at the center of everything that we do, to meet like-minded companies with big ideas we can help bring to life, and to share more of that journey here with you.</p>","backgroundImage":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":3,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=1140&h=380&q=100","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=285&h=95&q=100 285w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=570&h=190&q=100 570w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=1140&h=380&q=100 1140w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=1600&h=533&q=100 1600w","srcWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=1140&h=380&q=100&fm=webp","srcSetWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=285&h=95&q=100&fm=webp 285w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=570&h=190&q=100&fm=webp 570w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=1140&h=380&q=100&fm=webp 1140w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=1600&h=533&q=100&fm=webp 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px"},"seo":{"width":1200,"height":630,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=100&fit=fill","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=100&fit=fill 1x","srcWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=100&fm=webp&fit=fill","srcSetWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/JvSIBZWVM8gVwOL4gVVFp/6f8446b0912e22e631d28451df7737f7/Preview-Why_we_built_a_company_before_building_a_product-min.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=100&fm=webp&fit=fill 1x"}},"backgroundColor":"#fff"},{"postDate":"Oct. 8, 2019","pathPrefix":"articles","path":"articles/understanding-the-gatsby-lifecycle","readingTime":{"text":"4 minute read","minutes":3.948,"words":987,"time":236880},"id":"f3cbd1e2-e728-5507-b0d4-a9c20be8d0a0","title":"Understanding the Gatsby lifecycle","node_locale":"en","excerpt":"Gatsby is built with React at its core and shares a common API pattern, the lifecycle.

With the growing community interest in Gatsby, we hope to create more resources that make it easier for anyone to grasp the power of this incredible tool.</p><p>In this article I’ll explain how Gatsby’s lifecycle works and what the Gatsby specific files are for.</p><hr/><p>One of the challenges I had when learning Gatsby was trying to understand the Gatsby lifecycle. React introduced me to the concept of a Component Lifecycle, but when I started learning Gatsby I felt at a loss again. I remember looking through example repositories and seeing Gatsby specific files in every project and thinking to myself, “What are these files for? Why are <i>gatsby-node.js,</i> <i>gatsby-browser.js</i>, and <i>gatsby-ssr.js</i> generated in the default starter kit? Can I really delete these files?”</p><p><b>In this article I’ll explain the how Gatsby’s lifecycle works and what the Gatsby specific files are for.</b></p><h2>How does Gatsby work?</h2><p>To understand what these files are for, we must first understand how Gatsby works. Gatsby is a static site generator that pulls data from sources you provide and generates a website/app for you<u>.</u></p><p>Gatsby requires Node to be installed to run the Bootstrap and Build sequences. Under the hood, Gatsby uses Webpack to build and start a development server amongst other things.</p><h3>Step 1</h3><p>During the Bootstrap sequence, which occurs every time you run <i>$ gatsby develop</i>, there are about 20 events that fire ranging from validating your gatsby-config.js to building the data schemas and pages for your site. For example, the Bootstrap sequence is where Gatsby will create pages. If you want an in depth look of all 20 Bootstrap steps <a href=https://medium.com/@swyx target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Swyx</a> shared a <a href=https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/09306ec03df7b4cd8e7469bb74c078fb target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fantastic Gist</a> that goes into more detail.</p><h3>Step 2</h3><p>The Build sequence is very similar to the Bootstrap sequence, except it’s run with production optimizations and will output static files ready for deployment. Think of it as building your React application in production mode vs development.</p><h3>Step 3</h3><p>And finally, once the generated files are deployed, Gatsby lives in the browser. Gatsby cleverly generates a static website that turns into a web app after initial load, which extends the lifecycle to the browser.</p><p><b>What’s important to remember is that Gatsby’s lifecycle can be aggregated into 3 main sequences:</b></p><ol><li><p>Bootstrap</p></li><li><p>Build</p></li><li><p>Browser</p></li></ol><p>These three sequences makeup the Gatsby lifecycle.</p><hr/><h3>Parts of the lifecycle are visible when running <i>$ gatsby develop</i></h3>\n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <figure>\n              \n          <div class=\"image__container\">\n            <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x0gjv9ryol0f/7lAxbJOtM4lQkk6Q7jN94Q/5b01ee52d3a6bc1ee76d0b162658bd67/gatsby-narative-output.png\" alt=\"A peak into the Gatsby lifecycle when running $ gatsby develop\" class=\"image__regular \"/>\n          </div>\n              <figcaption>A peak into the Gatsby lifecycle when running $ gatsby develop</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n          </div>\n        <p>If you’re familiar with React and the component lifecycle, Gatsby’s lifecycle is almost the same concept.<b> </b>Just like React’s lifecycle, Gatsby exposes hooks for developers to build on top of. <b><i>Those lifecycle hooks are accessed through Gatsby specific files such as gatsby-node.js, gatsby-browser.js and gatsby-ssr.js</i></b>.</p><hr/><h2>What are the Gatsby specific files for?</h2><h3>gatsby-config.js</h3><p>A place to put all your site configurations such as plugins, metadata, and polyfills. This file is the blueprint of your application and is where Gatsby really shines with its plugin system. When you run <i>$ gatsby develop</i> or <i>$ gatsby build</i> gatsby-config.js is the first file to be read and validated.</p><p>Most of your time spent in gatsby-config.js will likely revolve around source plugins, image plugins, offline support, styling options, and site metadata.</p><h3>gatsby-node.js</h3><p>Gatsby runs a Node process when you develop or build your website and uses Webpack under the hood to spin up a development server with hot reloading. During the Node process Gatsby will load plugins, check the cache, bootstrap the website, build the data schema, create pages, and deal with some configuration and data management.</p><p>Everything that occurs during the Bootstrap and Build sequences occurs in gatsby-node.js. This means it’s the perfect place to create pages dynamically based off data from a source plugin or modify Gatsby’s Webpack or Babel configs.</p><p>For example, if you want to move some files manually, such as a Netlify _redirects file, a good place to do it is in your gatsby-node.js file at the onPostBuild lifecycle hook.</p><p>From experience, most of my time has revolved around handling data and building pages in gatsby-node.js. This file quickly becomes the piping of your entire website.</p><p><b>Examples of gatsby-node.js hooks:</b></p><ul><li><p>createPages</p></li><li><p>onCreateBabelConfig</p></li><li><p>onCreateWebpackConfig</p></li><li><p>onPostBuild</p></li></ul><h3>gatsby-ssr.js</h3><p>When you think Server Side Rendering you think of a server that takes in requests and dynamically builds pages and sends it to the client. Gatsby doesn’t do that, but it does server side render — it generates all the pages during build time.</p><p>Naturally, gatsby-ssr.js allows developers to hook into that lifecycle. In my experience, most use cases revolve around injecting CSS, HTML, or Redux state information into the generated output. For example, if you need to insert third party scripts such as Analytics Tracking or a Pixel it can be done on the <i>onRenderBody</i> gatsby-ssr.js hook.</p><p><b>Examples of gatsby-ssr.js hooks:</b></p><ul><li><p>onPreRenderHTML</p></li><li><p>onRenderBody</p></li><li><p>replaceRenderer</p></li></ul><h3>gatsby-browser.js</h3><p>Gatsby is a static site that loads a dynamic application after initial load, which means you get the benefits of a static site in a web application. gatsby-browser.js provides convenient hooks to deal with app loading, route updates, service worker updates, scroll positioning, and more.</p><p>Everything that occurs after your static site has loaded can be hooked in gatsby-browser.js. For apps that I’ve built, gatsby-browser.js was mostly used for keeping track of routes, scroll positioning, and sending analytics events.</p><p><b>Examples of gatsby-browser.js hooks:</b></p><ul><li><p>onClientEntry</p></li><li><p>onRouteUpdate</p></li><li><p>onServiceWorkerInstalled</p></li><li><p>registerServiceWorker</p></li><li><p>shouldUpdateScroll</p></li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Gatsby is built with React at its core and shares a common API pattern, the lifecycle. This lifecycle gives developers access to key moments in their website’s process through specific hooks. For example, adding analytics can be achieved through the <i>Browser</i> lifecycle hook <i>onClientEntry. </i>Gatsby reserves specific filenames as an entry point to access every lifecycle; these files are named <i>gatsby-node.js</i>, <i>gatsby-ssr.js</i> and <i>gatsby-browser.js</i>.</p><p>Without the Gatsby lifecycle, it would be impossible to customize and modify your project beyond the base configuration, leaving developers with a rigid and poor developer experience.
