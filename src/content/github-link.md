### Getting Started

Sigma (Î£) Protocol completely removes the need for a trusted setup, which is a major milestone for any privacy coin. In this design, RSA Accumulators which had previously been used for Zerocoin are replaced with Elliptic Curve Groups. As a side effect, Zerocoin proof sizes are reduced from 25 kB to around 1 kB and mint sizes cut by 75%, making Zerocoin much more scalable. Furthermore, it significantly enlarges anonymity sets (to >16,000 [tbd.]) and increases overall security. The latter is achieved by introducing 256-bit elliptic curves which, in terms of security, are roughly equivalent to 3072-bit RSA as opposed to 2048-bit RSA in use by Zerocoin before.
