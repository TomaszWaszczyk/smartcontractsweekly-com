### Getting Started

Sigma (Î£) Protocol completely removes the need for a trusted setup, which is a major milestone for any privacy coin. In this design, RSA Accumulators which had previously been used for Zerocoin are replaced with Elliptic Curve Groups. As a side effect, Zerocoin proof sizes are reduced from 25 kB to around 1 kB and mint sizes cut by 75%, making Zerocoin much more scalable. Furthermore, it significantly enlarges anonymity sets (to >16,000 [tbd.]) and increases overall security. The latter is achieved by introducing 256-bit elliptic curves which, in terms of security, are roughly equivalent to 3072-bit RSA as opposed to 2048-bit RSA in use by Zerocoin before.

After 6-12 months when the Zcoin blockchain grows due to MTP proof sizes...


Dash mixes transactions together. It a pretty bad privacy solution, and I don't think anyone considers them a privacy coin anymore.
Zcash and Zcoin are similar in the fact that they both use Zero Knowledge proofs to break down the links between coins.
but Zcoin's system has several advantages.


a) Trusteless setup

b) No exotic cryptography

c) Simple and easy to audit construction
