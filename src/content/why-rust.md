#### Introduction to Rust language

I just implemented "Hello World" application in Rust language and want to share my three cents about the language and why I have choosen to learn just Rust not another programming language.

```// This is the main function
fn main() {
    // Statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called

    // Just print text to the console
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```
